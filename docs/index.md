## Quick Start

Use Gistdex without installation:

```bash
# Using npx (recommended)
npx @ushironoko/gistdex --help

# Using pnpm dlx
pnpm dlx @ushironoko/gistdex --help
```

### Claude Code Integration

Add Gistdex to Claude Code with one command:

```bash
claude mcp add gistdex -- npx @ushironoko/gistdex --mcp
```

### Basic Usage

Initialize the database:

```bash
npx @ushironoko/gistdex init
```

Index your first content:

```bash
# Index a GitHub Gist
npx @ushironoko/gistdex index --gist https://gist.github.com/username/gist-id

# Index local files
npx @ushironoko/gistdex index --files "src/**/*.ts"

# Search indexed content
npx @ushironoko/gistdex query "how to implement authentication"
```

## Why Gistdex?

Gistdex uses semantic search to find content based on meaning rather than exact keywords. It indexes your code snippets, documentation, and text files for natural language queries.

### Key Features

- **Semantic Boundaries**: Preserves code and document structure when chunking
- **Local-First**: All data stays on your machine using SQLite or DuckDB with vector extensions
- **MCP Server**: Direct integration with Claude for AI-assisted search
- **CLI and Library**: Use as a command-line tool or integrate as a TypeScript library
